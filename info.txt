Solution

I created a Playfair table with the keyword

   0   1   2   3   4
0  M   Y   S   K   A
1  B   C   D   E   F
2  G   H   I   L   N
3  O   P   Q   R   T
4  U   V   W   X   Z



/------------------------------------------------------------------/
Playfair Square Generation (generate_playfair_square):

    The function creates a 5x5 matrix (Playfair square) using a keyword.

    It removes duplicate letters from the keyword and replaces 'J' with 'I' since the Playfair cipher combines 'I' and 'J' into a single cell.

    The rest of the alphabet (excluding 'J') fills the remaining cells of the matrix.

    The result is a 5x5 grid used for encrypting/decrypting messages.


/------------------------------------------------------------------/
Finding Character Positions (find_position):

    This function searches for a character in the Playfair square 
    and returns its row and column coordinates.


/------------------------------------------------------------------/
Decrypting the Ciphertext (decrypt_playfair):

    The function reads the ciphertext and processes it in pairs of characters.

    The decryption rules for the Playfair cipher are as follows:
        Same Row: If the characters are in the same row, move one column to the left (wrapping around if necessary).
        Same Column: If the characters are in the same column, move one row up (wrapping around if necessary).
        Rectangle Formation: If the characters form a rectangle, swap the columns of the characters.

    The function continues until all character pairs are processed.
